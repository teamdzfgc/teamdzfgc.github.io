                  On July 14th, the nine members who demonstrated outstanding
                  performance during the FGC training were selected to be part
                  of the FGC 2023 building team.<br /><br />These individuals
                  showcased remarkable dedication, discipline, and an insatiable

                    The initial step our team undertook was uniting our youthful
                    and brilliant minds through over five intensive
                    brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, we
                    meticulously dissected the challenges, deliberated on our
                    ideas, and formulated the necessary mechanisms.

                construction and coding.

                Much like the acquisition of technical skills, fostering
                cooperation, embracing responsibility, and nurturing solidarity
                form integral parts of this journey. These lessons crystallized
                vividly during our involvement in a community initiative.<br /><br />With

                dedicated to facilitating the healing of children with autism
                through equine therapy. Upon our arrival, we were warmly
                welcomed and guided through the premises, gaining insight into
                the therapeutic process. Subsequently, we immediately engaged in
                a hands-on demonstration of our commitment by undertaking a
                thorough cleaning of the facility. This gesture underscored our

                pouring their heart and soul into the mission at hand. Our

                and systems capable of executing all the requisite tasks set
                forth by this year's challenge. This goal remained steadfast,
                even during the most trying and complex junctures, when the
                burdens felt overwhelming and our spirits wavered. It was during
                these exact moments that our united front proved invaluable.
                Amidst exhaustion and dwindling motivation, we rallied each
                other with a resounding reminder: "This is our dream."
