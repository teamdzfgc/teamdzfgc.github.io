                <h3>Robocup</h3>
                <p>After weeks of courses and  learning , here we are facing our first challenge in this journey , "The Robocup competition" . We were divided into two groups then the mentors explained the challenge for us  : We need to make a robot that can perform like a football player , run , collect and shoot the balls . And they gave us one week to complete this task . We spent the first day and half of the second one analyzing , brainstorming and planning.</p>

              <img src="/images/1.jpg" class="img shadow">
              <p>When we had a clear plan we started working and building all together and using our problem solving skills to find solutions for the issues that we faced . In the last two days , we programmed our robots and tested them and just like that , the day of the competition arrived . The scores of the two teams were close , but there was a winning team , and the members of it were extremely happy and proud of what they did .</p>

                <h3>Flan vs Kongo</h3>
                <p>Once the first challenge was completed, there was a lot to wait for, which made our journey seem more exciting. This was our second challenge in our career as a team, where we rose to a second level of challenges, as we had to double the work and understanding with all members of the team to reach the highest level within one week, where we had to divide the tasks and work on one goal, which was to win against the second team.</p>

              <img src="/images/2.jpg" class="img shadow">
              <p>This challenge was completely different from what we went through, and what made us more anxious was that the matches would be held in front of sponsors , which made it increase the enthusiasm and tension at the same time among the team members, as it would be the first experience for most of them.</p>

                <p>Despite the noticeable progress throughout the week, the tension increased as soon as the end approached, as the team members became more anxious, and the technical problems began to worsen, as both teams began to accelerate the pace of work and try to find solutions as quickly as possible.</p>
