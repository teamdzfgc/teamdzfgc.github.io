                    Hello , my name is SLIMANI Meriem. I am 19 and I am admitted
                    into my third year of medical school . I have always been
                    passionate about STEM and inquiring knowledge from
                    everywhere possible. This desire inspired me to participate
                    in two editions of First Global Challenge ; in 2020 and in
                    2022. Those two experiences left an everlasting impact on me
                    and motivated me to take a teacherâ€™s training and become one
                    of the mentors of FGC team Algeria 2023.

                    Hello! I'm Soumia, and I'm participating as one of the
                    mentors for this year's team. I initially became involved in
                    the FGC competition during my freshman year of high school.
                    My experience as a technical team member allowed me to apply
                    and comprehend the concepts I was studying in school. As a
                    result of my involvement, I've enhanced my English skills,
                    engaged in similar opportunities, and developed my soft
                    skills. This year, I'm assisting the team with
                    problem-solving, brainstorming, and grasping mechanical
                    concepts.

                    Hello everyone, my name is Tarek, and I'm a mentor in this
                    year's (2023) First Global Challenge. My involvement in the
                    First Global Challenge began during the COVID-19 pandemic
                    with FGC 2021. Since then, my interest in robotics and STEAM
                    has continued to grow, leading me to participate in the 2022
                    session and both FGRC editions as well. These experiences
                    have helped me enhance my technical skills in the FGC
                    fields, enabling me to assist this year's team. Despite my
                    somewhat young age, I've also developed my soft skills
                    enough to be a mentor. I'm thrilled to share this passion of
                    mine with people who aspire to understand the immense
                    potential and achievements possible in this field. I hope to
                    continue on this path for both myself and my team!

                    more about programming during the training sessions . Also

                  <p>
                    Hey, im Younes, 16 years old, and am a high school student.
                    I usually practice sports as a hobby and am very interested
                    in robotics. My dream is to become the best version of
                    myself and i set it as a goal to always try to become better
                    at what I love doing. Being a member in the FGC2022, I saw
                    the great opportunity i had as i learnt so much during my
                    participation, and the reason why i joined this yearâ€™s
                    edition is to gain more experience, learn more in the world
                    of robotics and become as was the purpose of my
                    participation to become better while enjoying this
                    opportunity that i had to its fullest. During my two
                    participations in FGC, I could see myself change and improve
                    day after day whether it was for hard or soft skills where I
                    learnt again how to communicate better with others, working
                    in a group and even get more mature. Without forgetting the
                    technical side where I could add to my knowledge so much
                    more in mechanics, coding, solving problemsâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to
                    be the best teammate i can be to have as a role the one
                    being able to help everyone of his teammates and show the

                    Hello my name's Djekboub Ranym. i'm 16years old,high school
                    student.i like reading books and watching movies/series. I'm
                    utterly interested in petrochemistry/aeronautics although
                    when i was a kid i always wanted to be a vet. The reason why
                    i applied for the FGC is mainly my interest in mechanics and
                    so my will to represent my dear country the best way
                    possible and make my family proud. For me FGC really helped
                    in various fields in addition to upgrading both my soft and
                    hard skills,it also gave me the chance to meet amazing
                    people and spend time with them. As for now i hope i could
                    carry on with improving myself and use what my mentors and
                    friends have taught me to achieve that.

                    I am Khadidja , a 17 years old Algerian girl and a student
                    in the national mathematics highschool . Since my childhood
                    , I have been passionate about books , science and
                    technology . A few months ago I applied to join the Fgc
                    robotics training , where I learned a lot about mechanics
                    and programming and improved both my technical and soft
                    skills . When my mentors told me that I was selected to be
                    part of the Algerian national fgc robotics team , I felt
                    very proud of myself and grateful for this big opportunity,
                    but most importantly , I felt a huge responsibility on my
                    shoulders , a responsibility to make my family proud and
                    represent my country in the best way possible . The most
                    important value that this experience taught me is teamwork
                    and the power of it , the great things we can achieve when
                    working together and joining our minds .

                    programming them , and I really like learning new things Abt
                    the science related to computer and programming , my goal is
                    to succeed in my beloved topic and to make a solution for a
                    problem in our world and that's why I joined FGC . In FGC ,
                    I learned how to make robots , give them a task to do and
                    the best part is program them . In FGC , I work with my
                    teammates and share ideas to make a robot that runs well and
                    that's what made me make more friends and have fun all the
